# ü§ñ State Machines and Regular Languages

This section covers the foundational concepts of finite state machines (FSMs), their types, and the main theoretical results concerning regular languages.

## üß© What is a Finite State Machine (FSM)?

A **finite state machine** is an abstract computational model that:
- Has a **finite set of states**
- Reads input symbols one at a time
- Transitions between states according to a **transition function**
- (In some variants) produces output or accepts/rejects input

FSMs are used to define and recognize **regular languages**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Finite State Machines

### 1. **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**
- **Unique transition** per input symbol from each state.
- Can be defined as a tuple:  
  `M = (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q‚ÇÄ, F)`  
  where:
  - `Q`: finite set of states  
  - `Œ£`: input alphabet  
  - `Œ¥`: transition function `Œ¥: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí Q`  
  - `q‚ÇÄ ‚àà Q`: initial state  
  - `F ‚äÜ Q`: set of accepting states

### 2. **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**
- **Multiple transitions** allowed per input symbol.
- Accepts if at least one path leads to an accepting state.
- Transition function: `Œ¥: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí ùí´(Q)`
- Equivalent in power to DFA.

### 3. **Œµ-NFA (NFA with Œµ-transitions)**
- Like an NFA, but includes transitions that do not consume input.
- Also equivalent in power to DFA.

### 4. **Moore Machine**
- FSM with **output associated to states**.
- Output depends only on the current state.
- Can be defined as a 6-tuple with output function `Œª: Q ‚Üí Œì`.

### 5. **Mealy Machine**
- FSM with **output associated to transitions**.
- Output depends on both current state and input symbol.
- Output function: `Œª: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí Œì`.

## üìò Theorems and Results on Regular Languages

### Closure Properties of Regular Languages
The class of regular languages is closed under:
- **Union**
- **Concatenation** (juxtaposition, e.g., `r‚ÇÅr‚ÇÇ`)
- **Kleene star** (`r*`)
- **Intersection**
- **Complement**
- **Difference**
- **Reversal**
- **Homomorphism**
- **Inverse homomorphism**

### Myhill‚ÄìNerode Theorem
A language `L ‚äÜ Œ£*` is regular if and only if the number of equivalence classes of the relation:

`x ‚â°_L y ‚áî ‚àÄz ‚àà Œ£*, xz ‚àà L ‚áî yz ‚àà L`

is finite. This relation defines indistinguishability of strings with respect to `L`.

### Kleene‚Äôs Theorem (Equivalence between Regular Expressions and Finite Automata)
A language is regular if and only if it can be described by a regular expression, and equivalently if and only if it is recognized by a finite automaton (deterministic, nondeterministic, or Œµ-based). There are constructive conversions in both directions:
- From a regular expression to an equivalent automaton (e.g., Thompson‚Äôs construction yields an Œµ-NFA).
- From a finite automaton to a regular expression (e.g., state elimination or using Arden‚Äôs lemma).
- Nondeterministic automata can be transformed into deterministic ones via subset construction.

### Equivalence of Models
The following models recognize the same class of languages:
- **Deterministic Finite Automaton**
- **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton**
- **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton with Œµ-transitions**
- **Regular expressions**

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Regular Expression Operations

A regular expression over an alphabet `Œ£` is built using:
- **‚àÖ** (empty set)
- **Œµ** (empty string)
- **a**, for any `a ‚àà Œ£`
- **(r‚ÇÅ ‚à™ r‚ÇÇ)** (union)
- **r‚ÇÅr‚ÇÇ** (concatenation)
- **(r‚ÇÅ*)** (Kleene star)

These operations are sufficient to describe all regular languages.
