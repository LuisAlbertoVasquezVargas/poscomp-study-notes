# ü§ñ State Machines and Regular Languages

This section covers the foundational concepts of finite state machines (FSMs), their types, and the main theoretical results concerning regular languages.

---

## üß© What is a Finite State Machine (FSM)?

A **finite state machine** is an abstract computational model that:

* Has a **finite set of states**
* Reads input symbols one at a time
* Transitions between states according to a **transition function**
* (In some variants) produces output or accepts/rejects input

FSMs are used to define and recognize **regular languages**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Finite State Machines

### 1. **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**

* **Unique transition** per input symbol from each state.
* Can be defined as a tuple:
  `M = (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q‚ÇÄ, F)`
  where:

  * `Q`: finite set of states
  * `Œ£`: input alphabet
  * `Œ¥`: transition function `Œ¥: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí Q`
  * `q‚ÇÄ ‚àà Q`: initial state
  * `F ‚äÜ Q`: set of accepting states

### 2. **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**

* **Multiple transitions** allowed per input symbol.
* Accepts if at least one path leads to an accepting state.
* Transition function: `Œ¥: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí ùí´(Q)`
* Equivalent in power to DFA.

### 3. **Œµ-NFA (NFA with Œµ-transitions)**

* Like an NFA, but includes transitions that do not consume input.
* Also equivalent in power to DFA.

### 4. **Moore Machine**

* FSM with **output associated to states**.
* Output depends only on the current state.
* Can be defined as a 6-tuple with output function `Œª: Q ‚Üí Œì`.

### 5. **Mealy Machine**

* FSM with **output associated to transitions**.
* Output depends on both current state and input symbol.
* Output function: `Œª: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí Œì`.

## üìò Theorems and Results on Regular Languages

### Closure Properties of Regular Languages

The class of regular languages is closed under:

* **Union**
* **Concatenation** (juxtaposition, e.g., `r‚ÇÅr‚ÇÇ`)
* **Kleene star** (`r*`)
* **Intersection**
* **Complement**
* **Difference**
* **Reversal**
* **Homomorphism**
* **Inverse homomorphism**

### Myhill‚ÄìNerode Theorem

A language `L ‚äÜ Œ£*` is regular if and only if the number of equivalence classes of the relation:

`x ‚â°_L y ‚áî ‚àÄz ‚àà Œ£*, xz ‚àà L ‚áî yz ‚àà L`

is finite. This relation defines indistinguishability of strings with respect to `L`.

### Kleene‚Äôs Theorem (Equivalence between Regular Expressions and Finite Automata)

A language is regular if and only if it can be described by a regular expression, and equivalently if and only if it is recognized by a finite automaton (deterministic, nondeterministic, or Œµ-based). There are constructive conversions in both directions:

* From a regular expression to an equivalent automaton (e.g., Thompson‚Äôs construction yields an Œµ-NFA).
* From a finite automaton to a regular expression (e.g., state elimination or using Arden‚Äôs lemma).
* Nondeterministic automata can be transformed into deterministic ones via subset construction.

### Equivalence of Models

The following models recognize the same class of languages:

* **Deterministic Finite Automaton**
* **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton**
* **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton with Œµ-transitions**
* **Regular expressions**

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Regular Expression Operations

A regular expression over an alphabet `Œ£` is built using:

* **‚àÖ** (empty set)
* **Œµ** (empty string)
* **a**, for any `a ‚àà Œ£`
* **(r‚ÇÅ ‚à™ r‚ÇÇ)** (union)
* **r‚ÇÅr‚ÇÇ** (concatenation)
* **(r‚ÇÅ*)*\* (Kleene star)

These operations are sufficient to describe all regular languages.

## üßÆ Pushdown Automata (PDA)

PDAs extend finite automata with **a stack** to recognize **context-free languages (CFLs)**.

* **Deterministic PDA (DPDA)**:
  At most **one valid move** for any combination of `(state, input, stack symbol)`.

* **Nondeterministic PDA (NPDA)**:
  Allows **multiple possible moves** for the same configuration.

### Key Property:

* **NPDA recognizes all context-free languages (CFLs)**.
* **DPDA recognizes only deterministic context-free languages (DCFLs)**, which is a **strict subset** of CFLs.

**Therefore, DPDA ‚â† NPDA** in recognition power.

## üèó Two-Stack Automata

* A PDA with **two stacks** is equivalent to a **Turing Machine (TM)**.
* Turing Machines define the class of **recursively enumerable languages**.
* For Turing Machines:

  * **Deterministic TM (DTM)** vs **Nondeterministic TM (NTM)**:
    It is **unknown** whether they are equivalent in power.
    This question relates to the **P vs NP** problem.
