# ü§ñ Expert Systems ‚Äì Inference Engine

An **Expert System** is a software system designed to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert. It typically consists of:

- **Knowledge Base:** Contains facts and rules representing expert knowledge.
- **Inference Engine:** The core reasoning component.
- **User Interface:** Facilitates interaction with users.

---

## üîç Role of the Inference Engine

- Applies **logical rules** from the knowledge base to **known facts**.
- Derives **new facts or conclusions** through reasoning.
- Simulates **specialized human expert reasoning**.
- Works by:
  - **Forward chaining:** From facts to conclusions.
  - **Backward chaining:** From goals to facts.

## ‚ùå Common Misconceptions

- The inference engine is **not** responsible for UI management.
- It does **not** replace the knowledge base; it uses it.
- It is **not** primarily about optimizing machine learning algorithms.
- It does **not** only maintain or update databases without reasoning.
