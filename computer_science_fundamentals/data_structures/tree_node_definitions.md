## âœ… Key Definitions

### **Node**

A fundamental unit in a tree data structure.

---

### **Child**

A **child node** is a node that extends from another node (its **parent**).

* If node **C** is a child of node **A**, then **A** is the **parent** of **C**.
* **Example:** A computer connected to the Internet could be considered a child node of a node representing the Internet.

---

### **Parent**

The **inverse relationship** of a child: if **C** is a child of **A**, then **A** is the **parent** of **C**.

---

### **Degree**

The **degree of a node** is the **number of its children**.

---

### **Depth**

The **depth of a node** is the **length of the path from the node to the root node**.

* The **root node** has depth **0**.

---

### **Edge**

An **edge** is the **connection between two nodes**.

---

### **Forest**

A **forest** is a **set of disjoint trees**.

---

### **Height**

The **height of a node** is the **length of the longest path from the node down to a leaf node**.

---

### **Internal Node**

A node with **at least one child** (not a leaf).

---

### **Leaf Node**

A node with **no children**.

---

### **Root Node**

A node **distinguished from all others**, usually **depicted at the top of the tree**.

---

### **Sibling Nodes**

Nodes that **share the same parent**.
