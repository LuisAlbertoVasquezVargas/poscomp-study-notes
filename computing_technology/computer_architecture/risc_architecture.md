# RISC Architecture – Principles and Key Characteristics

## 1. Definition

**RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** is a CPU design philosophy focused on:

* **Simplicity of instructions**: Each instruction performs a small, well-defined operation.
* **Efficiency through pipelining**: Uniform instruction formats allow overlapping execution of multiple instructions.
* **Load/store architecture**: Arithmetic and logical operations work exclusively on registers; memory access is performed only with explicit load/store instructions.

The main goal of RISC is to maximize instruction throughput and simplify the processor design.

## 2. Core Characteristics

### 2.1 Data Alignment

RISC architectures enforce **strict data alignment**:

* For example, a 4-byte integer must reside at an address divisible by 4.
* Misaligned accesses are generally **not supported**, which simplifies memory access hardware and improves speed.

### 2.2 Register Usage

RISC CPUs use a **large number of general-purpose registers**, typically 16 or more:

* Register specifiers are usually **4 bits or more**, allowing access to many registers efficiently.
* Extensive use of registers reduces memory traffic and improves performance.

### 2.3 Load/Store Model

All operations occur **within registers**:

* Arithmetic, logic, and other operations **cannot directly access memory**.
* Memory access is performed **only through load or store instructions**.

This separation simplifies instruction decoding and improves execution speed.

### 2.4 Addressing Modes

RISC instructions include a **small number of simple addressing modes**:

* Usually fewer than five different modes, such as **immediate**, **register**, or **base+offset**.
* Addressing modes are **encoded in the instruction bits**, just like opcodes and register specifiers.
* Avoids complex or indirect memory access that requires multiple memory operations in a single instruction.
* **Each instruction accesses at most one memory operand**, ensuring predictable execution time.
* The limited set of addressing modes allows for simpler instruction decoding and predictable execution.

### 2.5 Memory Operands per Instruction

RISC instructions typically access **at most one memory operand**:

* Multiple memory accesses in a single instruction are avoided.
* Ensures uniform instruction timing and simpler pipelining.

### 2.6 Instruction Size

RISC instructions are **fixed-length**, usually **4 bytes (32 bits)**:

* Fixed-size instructions simplify fetching, decoding, and pipelining.
* Makes memory alignment predictable and performance more consistent.

## 3. RISC Instruction Format (Example)

```
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| opcode |  rs    |  rt    |  rd    |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| 6 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**

* **opcode**: specifies the operation (add, sub, load, store, etc.)
* **rs / rt / rd**: registers used by the instruction

  * `rs` = source register
  * `rt` = source register or destination for load instructions
  * `rd` = destination register for arithmetic/logical instructions
* **Immediate / offset field** (for load/store instructions): can replace `rd` or `rt` depending on the instruction
* **Memory operand**: **at most one memory operand per instruction** (for load/store instructions only)

**Key idea:** A RISC instruction may reference multiple registers (rs, rt, rd), but **only one memory operand** is accessed, ensuring simplicity and predictable timing.

## 4. Advantages of RISC Design

1. **Predictable performance** due to simple and uniform instructions.
2. **Efficient pipelining** and instruction-level parallelism.
3. **Simpler hardware** design, reducing CPU complexity.
4. **Reduced memory traffic** through heavy use of registers.
5. **Easier compiler optimization** due to regular instruction patterns.

## 5. Common Misconceptions

* RISC **does not allow arithmetic or logic instructions to directly modify memory operands**.
* The number of addressing modes is **well-defined and limited**, not “hard to determine.”
* Fixed instruction size is a deliberate design choice for simplicity and efficiency.
* **Each instruction accesses at most one memory operand**, never multiple in a single operation, even though multiple registers can be used.
