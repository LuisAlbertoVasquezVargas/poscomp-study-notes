# üìù Software Project Management Essentials

Software project management focuses on **planning, executing, and monitoring** software projects efficiently. It ensures that projects are delivered **on time, within budget, and meeting scope requirements**.

## 1. Core Focus of Project Management

Project management primarily deals with:

- **Project:** Planning, scheduling, resource allocation, risk monitoring, and overall execution.  
- **Note:** Management of **product** (the software itself) and **process** (methodologies like Agile or Waterfall) are generally considered separate from strict project management, although they interact closely.

## 2. Risk Analysis

- **Purpose:** Identify, assess, and mitigate potential threats or uncertainties that could negatively affect a project.  
- **Key Points:**
  - Evaluates **likelihood and impact** of risks.  
  - Helps prepare **contingency plans**.  
  - Does **not** assess feasibility within estimated cost/effort (that is the role of a feasibility study).

## 3. Project Scheduling Techniques

- **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique):**
  - Focuses on **estimating project duration** using probabilistic task times.  
  - Helps identify the **critical path**.  

- **CPM (Critical Path Method):**
  - Determines the **longest sequence of dependent tasks**.  
  - Useful for scheduling, resource allocation, and identifying potential delays.  

- Both techniques are **central to project planning** and timeline management.

## 4. Key Takeaways

- Project management strictly focuses on the **project scope, schedule, and resources**.  
- Risk management and scheduling are core components, whereas product and process management are related but **distinct areas**.  
- PERT and CPM are reliable tools for **scheduling and planning**.
