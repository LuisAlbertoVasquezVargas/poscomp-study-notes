# 🗂️ Software Configuration Management (SCM)

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is a critical discipline within software engineering focused on managing and controlling changes to software products during their entire lifecycle.

---

## 📌 Key Concepts

### 1. Software Configuration

- A **software configuration** is a **managed collection** of work products (also called **configuration items**, or CIs) that make up the system at a specific point in time.
- Examples of CIs include:
  - Source code files
  - Design documents
  - Test cases
  - Executables

> Note: It is **not** the entirety of *all* information generated during the software process, but a selected and controlled subset.

---

### 2. Hierarchy of Configuration Items

- As projects grow, CIs are organized in a **hierarchical structure**.
- Larger CIs are composed of smaller, nested CIs, for example:
  - System → Subsystems → Modules → Components → Files
- This hierarchy helps in managing complexity and dependencies.

---

### 3. Purpose and Activities of SCM

SCM encompasses a set of coordinated activities to:

- Identify configuration items
- Control changes to those items
- Record and report the status of items and change requests
- Audit configurations to verify integrity and consistency

SCM covers the **entire software lifecycle** — from initial requirements to development, maintenance, and retirement.

## 🧠 POSCOMP Tips

- SCM is about **control and traceability** of software artifacts.
- It ensures **consistency** when multiple team members modify software.
- A **configuration baseline** is a formally reviewed and agreed-upon version of a configuration item.
