# Matrix Inverse via Gauss-Jordan Elimination

TODO(luisvasquez): Add explanation of inverting matrices using the Gauss-Jordan method.

Outline:
1. Start with matrix A and identity matrix I
2. Form [A | I]
3. Apply row operations to reduce A to I, and I becomes A⁻¹

> Add at least one example and common pitfalls.
