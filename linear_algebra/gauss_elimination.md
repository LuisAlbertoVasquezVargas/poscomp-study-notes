# Gauss Elimination Method

TODO(luisvasquez): Add notes about Gauss elimination method for solving linear systems.

Steps:
1. Write the augmented matrix [A | b]
2. Apply elementary row operations to reduce it to row echelon form
3. Back-substitute to find the solution vector x

> Consider adding examples and typical POSCOMP-style exercises here.
