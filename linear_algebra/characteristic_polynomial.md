# Characteristic Polynomial

The **characteristic polynomial** of a square matrix \( A \) is defined as:

$$
\det(\lambda I - A) = 0
$$

Where:

- **Î»** (lambda) is a scalar (eigenvalue).  
- **I** is the identity matrix of the same size as \( A \).  
- **det** denotes the determinant.  

Solving the characteristic polynomial equation

$$
\det(\lambda I - A) = 0
$$

gives the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A \).
