# Characteristic Polynomial

The **characteristic polynomial** of a square matrix $A$ is defined as:

$$
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0
$$

Where:

* **Î»** (lambda) is a scalar (eigenvalue).
* **I** is the identity matrix of the same size as $A$.
* **det** denotes the determinant.

Solving the characteristic polynomial equation

$$
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0
$$

yields the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.
