## Integration by Parts

The integration by parts formula is:

âˆ«uÂ·dv = uÂ·v âˆ’ âˆ«vÂ·du

---

## Suggested Structure

### Derivation

Start from the product rule:

d(uv)/dx = uÂ·dv/dx + vÂ·du/dx

Now integrate both sides:

âˆ«d(uv)/dx dx = âˆ«uÂ·dv + âˆ«vÂ·du

So:

uv = âˆ«uÂ·dv + âˆ«vÂ·du  
â‡’ âˆ«uÂ·dv = uv âˆ’ âˆ«vÂ·du

### Examples

- âˆ«xÂ·eË£ dx
- âˆ«ln(x) dx
- âˆ«xÂ·cos(x) dx
