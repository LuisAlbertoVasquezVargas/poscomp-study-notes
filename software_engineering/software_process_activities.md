# ‚öôÔ∏è Fundamental Activities in Software Processes

According to *Ian Sommerville* in *Software Engineering*, a **software process** is a set of related activities that result in the development and evolution of a software system. These activities are **universal** across all software engineering projects, regardless of process model (e.g., waterfall, agile).

## üìã 1. Software Specification

> "Understanding and defining what services are required from the system and identifying the constraints on its operation and development."

- Focus: **What** the system should do.
- Includes:
  - Requirements elicitation
  - Functional and non-functional requirements
  - Constraints (technical, legal, business)
- Outcome: A **requirements specification document** or equivalent.

---

## üèóÔ∏è 2. Software Design and Implementation

- Translates the specification into an executable system.
- **Design**: Describes how the system will be structured and how components interact.
- **Implementation**: Writing the source code and integrating components.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Software Validation

- Ensures the software **meets the specification** and fulfills user expectations.
- Includes:
  - Testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance)
  - Reviews and inspections
- Often phrased as: "Are we building the right product?"

---

## üîÅ 4. Software Evolution (Maintenance)

- Modifying software **after delivery** to adapt to new needs or fix problems.
- Includes:
  - Bug fixes
  - Performance improvements
  - Adaptation to new environments

| Activity                | Key Focus                              | Typical Question Answered          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Software Specification  | **What** the system must do             | "What are the requirements?"        |
| Design & Implementation | **How** the system will be built        | "How will it work?"                 |
| Software Validation     | **Does** the system meet expectations?  | "Are we building the right thing?"  |
| Software Evolution      | **What happens after delivery?**        | "How do we adapt or improve it?"    |
